	<p style= "color:#592925";>	I thought the year 2019 was bad. Turns out, this year was much worse. This pandemic has 
		spread to all parts of the world. Seven months have passed since the declaration of quarantine.
		I almost feel like a vampire who has not seen sunlight in a million years. COVID-19 is tough. 
		It won’t just go away. Every day, approximately 2000 cases are reported. In a blink of an eye, a
		single case turned into almost 400,000 cases in seven months. Various efforts have been made by 
		the Philippine Government. Were their efforts effective in defeating the virus? Our neighboring 
		countries have suppressed the threat of the virus. Why haven’t we?
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="a">
	<p style= "color:#40241A";> Surely there is a problem with how the government handles this pandemic. During the first few months
		of the start of the pandemic, there was a lack of PPE and hospital beds in various healthcare facilities nationwide. 
		This problem somehow has been resolved. Recently, the target number of testings has not been achieved. People need 
		their jobs to fulfill their families’ needs. Businesses have shut down and many jobs have been lost. Sadly, even my 
		favorite branch of Jollibee has shut down.  Even the Department of Labor and Employment Secretary, Silvestre Bello III, 
		has admitted that 10 million people may lose their jobs due to the pandemic.

	<div class="a">
	<p style= "color:#592925";> There are some situations that I find unnecessary during the pandemic. The best “joke” that I have heard this pandemic 
	is President Duterte insisting on using kerosene as a disinfectant against COVID-19. Chemists, later on, warns those who 
	actually believe the President that gasoline must not be used as a disinfectant for it is harmful. President Duterte also 
	mentions that the lack of funds is the Philippines’ greatest problem. While funds are the greatest problem right now, PhilHealth 
	officials got caught in allegations that they stole 15 billion pesos. Isn’t health insurance what we most need in a time that we 
	are at risk of getting sick from the virus? Another thing is the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. Why can’t they just do the bare minimum 
	of cleaning up the trash? Is spending 28 million pesos on adding white sand to Manila Bay really worth it? Maybe the long yearned cure for 
	the virus is the white sand after all. 
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="a">
	<p style= "color:#40241A";> Yes, there are efforts made by the government that are effective and reasonable. There situations mentioned that are not yet resolved. 
	There are also decisions made by the Government that are not necessary nor relevant to the pandemic. Although if I were to write everything, 
	it would create a whole thick book.
